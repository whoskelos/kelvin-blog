## Why wordpress?
The client contact me to review his website because he wanted to make some changes.

After I reviewed it, we had a call and I told him what we can improve, and he said he want the website build in Wordpress because If he want to edit anything after I deliver the website he can do it.

## How I start?
I watched some videos to prepare my development enviroment in my computer because I had an older version of Wordpress. After I prepared the development enviroment, I started to build the website.

I did a research about which Wordpress block system I can use, I found that the latest version of Wordpress uses Gutenberg. Gutenberg is a new block editor for WordPress that allows you to create and edit content in a more intuitive way. I chose the color scheme of the website based on the client's logo.

I designed the Home page first, so the client can have a preview of the website. After the client approved the Home page, I started to build the other pages. Because I was creating the website after my working hours, It took me 2 weeks to finish the website.

## Conclusion
Designing a website in Wordpress is very intuitive and easy to use when you have a basic understanding of how it works.

## What's next?
I'm going to continue learning about Wordpress and build more websites with it.
