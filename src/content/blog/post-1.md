## Why astro?
Nowadays are many options to build a website but I choose Astro because is a framework that I enjoy when I build something.

Other reason is because Astro is a good option for static websites like a Blog, portfolios, landing pages, this doesn't mean you can't build an e-commerce with Astro.

Also you can use your own UI components from another frameworks like React, Preact, Vue.

And last, but not least, Astro loads 0 Javascript by default.

## What's next
Keep learning and going deep with Astro.
